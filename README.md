# IDDTool
Editor for Bayonetta *.idd textures

This tool will allow you to edit the textures inside the *.idd files on Bayonetta games. It only supports the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.

To use it:
- Click in File -> Open, select the IDD you want to edit.
- The first list will show all textures inside the IDD file.
- Now click on a texture name to preview and edit.
- The second list contains all the "items" or "elements" on the texture, those can be words, images and such.
- You can use the Export buttons to export the texture to the format of your choice (PNG or DDS).
- You can use the Import buttons to insert the modified texture back, but it needs to have the same size (Width X Height).
- It's recommended that you Import DDS, since the encoder of you editing software is likely to produce better results than the built-in DXT encoder.
- Make sure that the DXT format and size are the same, and that the image doesn't have mipmaps when importing your DDS.
- You can bring up the region of any item inside of the texture by right-clicking on it.
- You can then use the bottom controls or the mouse to resize or move the region.
- Once everything is done, you can save your changes by clicking on File -> Save or using the Ctrl + S shortcut.
